# Sale_Prediction

## Dataset:
[Kaggle Competition: Predict Future Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/overview)

## Objective:
Given historical sales time-series data from January 2013 to October 2015, including shop name, shop id, item name, item id, item price and item sale amount.
Our task is to use given data to predict November 2015 product sales.

## Motivation:
For many shops and stores, predicting future sales of products can be useful.  They have old sales data and want to know future sales to make decisions of the amount of a certain product to buy and how many of this product to allocate into each store.

Only after knowing the consumers' willingness to buy a certain product can maximize their profit and minimize the loss of over ordering of a certain product.  

In this case, predicting the amount of each product sale in the future can be useful, here we use the sales data of Russian shops to build the model.

## Concerns and possible questions:
1. why is Arima telling us the data is not fit, what kind of data is good to use Arima?

2. is LSTM really good to use?  What is the ground thoughts of LSTM?

3. why is deep learning method more accurate?
